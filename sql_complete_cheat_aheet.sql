CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  department_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
--department_id column in the employees table is a foreign key that references the department_id column in the departments table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

--42. UNIQUE
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
--email column must contain unique values for each employee.

INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
--This query will retrieve records from both the employees and departments tables where there is a match on the department_id column.

--46. LEFT JOIN
SELECT * FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
--This query will retrieve all records from the employees table and only the matching records from the departments table.

WHERE e1.employee_id = e2.manager_id;
--In this example, the employees table is joined to itself to find employees and their respective managers based on the manager_id column.

--SQL Functions
--In this section we have compiled SQL cheat sheet for SQL functions. It is used for common tasks like aggregation, filtering, date/time manipulation, and more!

--51. Scalar Functions
SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS upper_case_name FROM employees;
--This query uses the UPPER() scalar function to convert the first_name column values to uppercase.

--52. Aggregate Functions
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
--This query uses the AVG() aggregate function to calculate the average salary of all employees.

--53. String Functions
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
--This query uses the CONCAT() string function to concatenate the first_name and last_name columns into a single column called full_name.

SELECT SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 3) AS short_name FROM employees;
--This query uses the SUBSTR() function to extract the first three characters of the first_name column for each employee. The result is displayed in a new column called short_name.

SELECT INSERT(full_name, 6, 0, 'Amazing ') AS modified_name 
FROM (SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees) AS employee_names;
--This query first concatenates the first_name and last_name columns into a single column called full_name. Then, it uses the INSERT() function to insert the string 'Amazing ' at the 6th position of the full_name column for each employee. The modified names are displayed in a new column called modified_name.

--54. Date and Time Functions
SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS current_date FROM dual;
--This query uses the CURRENT_DATE date function to retrieve the current date.

--55. Mathematical Functions
SELECT SQRT(25) AS square_root FROM dual;
--This query uses the SQRT() mathematical function to calculate the square root of 25.

--Subqueries in SQL
--This SQL cheat sheet explains how to nest queries for powerful data filtering and manipulation within a single statement.

--56. Single-row Subquery
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
--In this example, the subquery (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) returns a single row containing the maximum salary, and it's used to filter employees who have the maximum salary.

--57. Multiple-row Subquery: Returns Multiple Rows of Result
SELECT department_name
FROM departments
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM employees);
--In this example, the subquery (SELECT department_id FROM employees) returns multiple rows containing department IDs, and it's used to filter department names based on those IDs.

--58. Correlated Subquery
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department);
--In this example, the subquery (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department) is correlated with the outer query by referencing the department column from the outer query. It calculates the average salary for each department and is used to filter employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of their respective department.

--59. Nested Subquery
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'IT'
);
--In this example, the subquery (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'IT') is nested within the outer query. It retrieves the department ID for the IT department, which is then used in the outer query to filter employees belonging to the IT department.

--Views in SQL
--Here in this SQL cheat sheet unveils how to create virtual tables based on existing data for streamlined access.

60. CREATE VIEW
CREATE VIEW high_paid_employees AS
SELECT *
FROM employees

63. DROP INDEX: --Remove an Index
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_department;
--This query drops the idx_department index if it exists.

--Transactions in SQL
--Learn how to manage groups of database operations as a single unit for reliable data updates.

--64. BEGIN TRANSACTION
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

--In the last we have complied all the imprtant queries under the one advanced SQL cheat sheet.

--67. Stored Procedures
CREATE PROCEDURE get_employee_count()
BEGIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
END;

--68. Triggers
CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  SET NEW.creation_date = NOW();
END;
--This query creates a trigger named before_employee_insert that sets the creation_date column to the current date and time before inserting a new employee record.

--69. User-defined Functions (UDFs)
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_bonus(salary DECIMAL) RETURNS DECIMAL
BEGIN
  RETURN salary * 0.1; -- 10% bonus
END;
--This query creates a user-defined function named calculate_bonus that calculates the bonus based on the salary.

--70. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
WITH high_paid_employees AS (
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000
)
SELECT * FROM high_paid_employees;
--This query uses a common table expression named high_paid_employees to retrieve all employees with a salary greater than 60000.
